# 5-Day-Weather-Forecast
## Description
This project is a 5-Day-Weather-Forecast with the intention to help figure out the weather for a inputed city. This forecast will display the day, temperature, wind speed, and humidity of each day. Then, the user can input what city they want to know about and that input is saved to local storage. Finally, this input will persist in a list on the page.    

## Usage
* Go to the site: https://kylem021199.github.io/5-Day-Weather-Forecast/ 
* the user will input a city in the text box
* the user's input will be saved upon clicking the search button and displays the forecast
